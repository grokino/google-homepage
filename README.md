div: "main" is a container for the google logo. It uses the class .main which is referenced on the style sheet.

Div: class  "searchbar1" is a container for the search bar.
It uses the class .searchbar1
inside the div:
1) input with a 'text' attribute. This also holds the css class .searchbar

For the nav bars I simply brok up the links into two different containers. so I could easily seperate them to the right and left.
I experimented with padding and margins to get the text where I needed to.
I believe there would have been a much easier way to do all of this, I am still lacking in essential css knowledge.

changed the style of the buttons by giving them an id.
Used the colour a9efee (light grey)

...end of notes.....
